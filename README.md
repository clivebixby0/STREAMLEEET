Project Contents: 
This project contains the details of what was done by
each group member in Activity #2. 

For context, Activity #2 was about performing data anaylsis
on the dataset given to our group, which in this case is
about Electronic Sales Data (Customer Purchase Behavior).

Each group member was assigned a specific graph to show.
*   Perico, Frederick Lemuel A.
    - Violin Plot
        -   A violin plot that shows the total price by product type.
        -   The graph shows that "smartphones had the highest total price".

    - Pie Chart
        -   A pie chart that shows the share of each payment method.
        -   As seen in the pie chart, Credit Card as the customers payment
            method is the most used one. Slightly ahead of PayPal which was at
            29.0% (Credit Card was at 29.3%).
        -   Debit Card on the other hand comes out as the least preferred payment
            method (12.4%), closely tied with Cash which is at 12.5%.

    - Scatter Plot
        - A scatter plot that shows the Total Price vs Quantity of the items purchased.

    - Histogram
        -   The histogram shows the "Total Price across all transactions".
        -   0-2000 Total Price is the most frequent, following a trend that goes
            down in price the higher the total price becomes.

*   Macatangay, Robin Jairic T.
    - Bubble Chart
        - A bubble chart that shows the "Total Price vs Quantity" (with the Bubble size signifying Add-on Total).
        - The bubble chart shows a positive relationship between the
          Quantity and Total Price (although as mentioned in the notes, 
          "it can vary depending on the type of product purchased").
        - The size of the bubbles in the chart signifies that Smartphone 
          and Laptop purchases are more likely to have add-ons together with the product.

    - Box Plot
        - A box plot that shows the distribution of Total Price between each Payment Method.
        - The box plot shows that Bank Transfers are more commonly used for payments that are
          larger.
        - On the other hand, cash is used for "lower-value transactions".

*   Aguas, Ynikko Arzee Neo D.
    - Bar Graph
        - A bar graph that shows the Average Price by Product Type.
        - The graph shows that Smartphones and Smartwatches have the highest average price.
        - Headphones are by far the lowest out of all the products.

    - Line Graph
        - A Line Graph is shown which displays the "Total Quantity Purchased Over Time".
        - The quantity starts fairly low according to the graph, but then skyrockets between
          the dates 2024-01 to 2024-03.

*   Almandres, Villy Joel H.
    - Area Chart
        - An area chart that shows the "Monthly Sales Revenue".
        - The Graph shows that the date 2023-09 - 2023-12 had the lowest recorded period in revenue.
        - It also shows a sudden revenue growth that plateaued between the dates 2024-01 to 2024-08.

    - Tree Map
        - A Tree Map that showcases the share of each product type.
        - Smartphones take up 29.89% the share, which is by far the biggest.
        - Followed by Tablet (20.52%), Smartwatch (19.67%), and Laptop (19.86%).
        - Headphones however, lags behind at only 10.06%.

Each of the graphs showcases data categories that were present inside the database.
With the data visualized, one can point out key trends, and devise their future plans
with said key trends in mind. Although sometimes the data in the graph does not necessarily
tell the entire story, which means that lots of research may need to be done in order to extract
the true significance of the data.
